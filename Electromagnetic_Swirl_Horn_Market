What Is an Electromagnet Swirl Horn?
An electromagnet swirl horn is a device that leverages the properties of electromagnetism to manipulate and focus sound waves. Unlike conventional horns, which primarily amplify sound, swirl horns use electromagnetic forces to shape and direct sound waves into specific patterns. This capability allows these devices to convey sound with greater specificity and reduced distortion, which is crucial in certain environmental settings.
These devices are particularly useful in sonar systems, automotive collision avoidance systems, and high-fidelity audio products. The core of their operation lies in the ability of the electromagnet to create a swirling or rotating magnetic field, which interacts with the sound waves and guides them in a highly controlled manner.
