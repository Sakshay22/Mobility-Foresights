Pneumatic Rollers
These are compactors specialized in compacting fine-grained soils. They are used mainly in applications that need a relatively smooth surface, typical of applications like asphalt paving.
Sheepsfoot Rollers
This compactor is designed in the form of a cylinder with the surface protruding with knobs, imitating the foot of a sheep. It is used in cohesive soils, from clay downwards, and is mainly used in the early stages of compaction.
Padfoot Compactors
Padfoot compactors function the same as of sheepsfoot rollers, the difference is that they provide deep compaction, so they are used in more massive projects.
Market Drivers

4. Government Initiatives and Investments
With the countries gearing to re-inforce the economy, the infrastructure has been peeking its head amidst nearly every state. Several project and investments are recorded with such infrastructure development over the transport network, public utilities, or housing. They turn out to be a significant factor in boosting the construction activity—soil compactors ultimate essential to achieve compacting excellence in such infrastructure projects.
Barriers
1. High Capital COST
The major limitation is the high purchase cost of compactors. This discourages a lot of small-to-medium construction companies that operate on small budgets from acquiring the equipment. Apart from that, the requirement for a large capital outlay deters some companies from purchasing the latest and highest improved models, a situation that may lead to stagnation in the growth of market size.
2. Maintenance and Operational Costs
Soils compactors call for the need for occasional servicing depending on usage, and this involves extra expenses. Operating costs also encompass parameters such as fuel and operator training, which might not be cost-effective for building companies, especially those that work with small profit margins.
3. Environmental Concerns
Environmental regulations are increasingly putting many industries under scrutiny, and the construction industry is no exception to this. Soil compactors, being mainly diesel-powered, pose concerns such as atmospheric pollution and the release of greenhouse gases. This challenge of stricter environmental regulations would automatically be important to a soil compactor manufacturer, as the impacts can easily turn into adverse market effects.
4. Fluctuation in Raw Material Prices
The price of raw materials, such as steel material, rubber, and hydraulic elements which form part of making soil compactors, is characterized by volatility. The fluctuation translates into higher amounts that also reflect in soil compactor prices, which become too costly for end-users. On the flip side, this makes it hard on the manufacturing companies to keep the profits coming with current cost structures, especially when raw material costs keep surging from time to time.
